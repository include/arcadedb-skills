Can you help me design the schema and write the SQL to create it? I also need a query that finds friends-of-friends who have posted about 'AI' in the last week. I'll be connecting via the HTTP API from my Node.js backend.",

Can you show me how these translate to ArcadeDB's OpenCypher? Also, what are the gotchas we should watch out for during migration? Our biggest query finds shortest paths between two nodes with weighted edges.",

How do I configure all this?",
